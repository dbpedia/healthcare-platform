  "description": "Read the [associated blogpost](https://heads0rtai1s.github.io/2020/04/30/animate-map-covid/) for a detailed description of how this dataset was prepared; plus extra code for producing animated maps.\n \n### Context\n\nThe 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread in countries around the world. This dataset provides daily updated number of reported cases & deaths in Germany on the federal state (Bundesland) and county (Landkreis/Stadtkreis) level. In April 2021 I added a dataset on vaccination progress. In addition, I provide geospatial shape files and general state-level population demographics to aid the analysis.\n\n### Content\n\nThe dataset consists of thre main csv files: `covid_de.csv`, `demgraphics_de.csv`, and `covid_de_vaccines.csv`. The geospatial shapes are included in the `de_state.*` files. See the column descriptions below for more detailed information.\n\n- `covid_de.csv`: COVID-19 cases and deaths which will be updated daily. The original data are being collected by Germany's [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) and can be download through the [National Platform for Geographic Data](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/) (the latter site also hosts an interactive dashboard). I reshaped and translated the data (using R tidyverse tools) to make it better accessible. [This blogpost](https://heads0rtai1s.github.io/2020/04/30/animate-map-covid/) explains how I prepared the data, and describes how to produces animated maps.\n\n- `demographics_de.csv`: General Demographic Data about Germany on the federal state level. Those have been downloaded from Germany's Federal Office for Statistics ([Statistisches Bundesamt](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html)) through their Open Data platform [GENESIS](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online/data?operation=sprachwechsel&language=en). The data reflect the (most recent available) estimates on 2018-12-31. You can find the corresponding table [here](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=12411-0013&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1615126323625#abreadcrumb ).\n\n- `covid_de_vaccines.csv`: In April 2021 I added this file that contains the Covid-19 vaccination progress for Germany as a whole. It details daily doses, broken down cumulatively by manufacturer, as well as the cumulative number of people having received their first and full vaccination. The earliest data are from 2020-12-27.\n\n- `de_state.*`: Geospatial shape files for Germany's 16 federal states. Downloaded via Germany's [Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy ](https://www.bkg.bund.de/EN/Home/home.html). Specifically, the shape file was obtained from [this link](https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/open-data/verwaltungsgebiete-1-2-500-000-stand-01-01-vg2500.html).\n\n\n### Column Description\n\nCOVID-19 dataset `covid_de.csv`:\n\n- `state`: Name of the German federal state. Germany has 16 federal states. I removed converted special characters from the original data.\n\n- `county`: The name of the German Landkreis (LK) or Stadtkreis (SK), which correspond roughly to US counties.\n\n- `age_group`: The COVID-19 data is being reported for 6 age groups: 0-4, 5-14, 15-34, 35-59, 60-79, and above 80 years old. As a shortcut the last category I'm using \"80-99\", but there might well be persons above 99 years old in this dataset. This column has a few NA entries.\n\n- `gender`: Reported as male (M) or female (F). This column has a few NA entries.\n\n- `date`: The calendar date of when a case or death were reported. There might be delays that will be corrected by retroactively assigning cases to earlier dates.\n\n- `cases`: COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed through laboratory work. This and the following 2 columns are counts per day, not cumulative counts.\n\n- `deaths`: COVID-19 related deaths.\n\n- `recovered`: Recovered cases.\n\n\nDemographic dataset `demographics_de.csv`:\n\n- `state`, `gender`, `age_group`: same as above. The demographic data is available in higher age resolution, but I have binned it here to match the corresponding age groups in the `covid_de.csv` file.\n\n- `population`: Population counts for the respective categories. These numbers reflect the (most recent available) estimates on 2018-12-31.\n\n\nVaccination progress dataset `covid_de_vaccines.csv`:\n\n- `date`: calendar date of vaccination\n\n- `doses`, `doses_first`, `doses_second`: Daily count of administered doses: total, 1st shot, 2nd shot.\n\n- `pfizer_cumul`, `moderna_cumul`, `astrazeneca_cumul`: Daily cumulative number of administered vaccinations by manufacturer.\n\n- `persons_first_cumul`, `persons_full_cumul`: Daily cumulative number of people having received their 1st shot and full vaccination, respectively.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAll the data have been extracted from open data sources which are being gratefully acknowledged:\n\n- The [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) for collecting, verifying, and publishing the COVID-19 cases.\n\n- The [National Platform for Geographic Data](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/) provided by [ESRI Germany](https://www.esri.de/de-de/home) for the COVID-19 dashboard and data access.\n\n- The [Statistisches Bundesamt](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html)) and their open data platform [GENESIS](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online/data?operation=sprachwechsel&language=en) for providing access to detailed demographic information about Germany.\n\n- The [Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy](https://www.bkg.bund.de/EN/Home/home.html) for providing geospatial shape files.\n\n- The website [Impfdashboard.de](https://impfdashboard.de/) for providing up-to-date vaccination numbers.\n\n\n### Licence\n\nThe demographic data & geospatial shape files are being licensed via the  \"Data licence Germany \u2013 attribution \u2013 Version 2.0\" available [here](https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0). \n\n\n### Version Notes\n\n- Version 8: The source data was incomplete on 2020-04-04, therefore the file `covid_de.csv` remained unchanged. I added county-level shape files.\n\n- Version 11: A `recovered` column was added to the main `covid_de.csv` file. This reflects the addition of daily counts of recovered cases to the source data. In addition, the 2020-04-07 source data was incomplete and I didn't upload a new update that day.\n\n- Version 13: The previous day 2020-04-10 had incomplete source data and I didn't upload a new update that day.",
